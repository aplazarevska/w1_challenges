                            <li>1/3 cup (50g) white sesame seeds, toasted</li>

                    <h3>Method</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>For the miso tahini dressing, place all ingredients in a bowl with 1 tsp salt flakes and 100ml water and whisk until smooth and combined. Store in an airtight container, chilled, for up to 2 days.</li><br>
                            <li>For the classic poké dressing, place all ingredients and 50ml water in a clean screw-top jar and shake to combine. Store, chilled, for up to 2 months.</li><br>
                            <li>For the pickled carrot and daikon, soak carrot and daikon in iced water for 5 minutes, then drain. Transfer to a bowl with garlic, sugar and 2 tbs salt flakes, and toss to combine. Transfer to a clean 1L (4-cup) glass jar, add vinegar and 1 cup (250ml) water, and chill for 2 hours or overnight. Store, chilled, for up to 2 weeks.</li><br>
                            <li>For the crispy onions, place oil and onion in a large saucepan over high heat and cook for 2 minutes or until oil begins to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring every 5 minutes, for 30-35 minutes or until onion is golden brown.</li><br>
                            <li>Remove from heat and stand for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove onion from oil and drain well on paper towel (the onion will crisp up as it cools). Lightly season onion with salt flakes and store, on fresh paper towel in an airtight container at room temperature, for up to 6 days.</li><br>
                            <li>For the nori katsuobushi furikake, heat a frypan over high heat. Add nori and cook, turning halfway, for 1 minute or until warmed through and slightly toasted. Transfer to a small food processor with remaining ingredients and 1 tsp salt flakes, and pulse until finely chopped. Store, in an airtight container at room temperature, for up to 4 weeks.</li><br>
                            <li>For the poké bowl, place miso tahini dressing and tofu in a large bowl and toss to combine. Place cabbage, shredded kale and kale leaves in a separate bowl with 2 tbs classic poke dressing and toss to combine.</li><br>
                            <li>Divide cabbage mixture among serving bowls. Arrange tofu mixture, mushrooms, beetroot, cucumber, radish, edamame, bean sprouts and pickled carrot and daikon on top.

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 ½ teaspoons + 2 tablespoons avocado oil or safflower oil, divided</li>
                            <li>2 eggs, whisked together</li>
                            <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>

                            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, more to taste</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon grated or finely minced fresh ginger</li>
                            <li>2 large cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
                            <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
                            <li>2 cups cooked brown rice</li>
                            <li>1 cup greens (optional), such as spinach, baby kale or tatsoi</li>
                            <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
                            <li>Chili-garlic sauce or sriracha, for serving (optional)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>This recipe comes together quickly. Before you get started, make sure that all of your ingredients are prepped and within an arm’s reach from the stove. Also have an empty bowl nearby for holding the cooked eggs and veggies. I’m suggesting that you start over medium-high heat, but if at any point you catch a whiff of oil or food burning, reduce the heat to medium.</li><br>
                            <li>Warm a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until a few drops of water evaporate within a couple of seconds. Immediately add 1 ½ teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom. Cook until they are just lightly set, flipping or stirring along the way. Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof spatula.</li><br>
                            <li>Return the pan to heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
                            <li>Add the remaining veggies and salt. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally (don’t stir too often, or the veggies won’t have a chance to turn golden on the edges), until the veggies are cooked through and turning golden, about 3 to 5 more minutes. In the meantime, use the edge of your spatula or a spoon to break up the scrambled eggs into smaller pieces.</li><br>
                            <li>Use a big spatula or spoon to transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl with the cooked eggs. Return the pan to heat and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and mix it all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
                            <li>Add the greens (if using) and green onions, and stir to combine. Add the cooked veggies and eggs and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tamari and sesame oil. Taste, and add a little more tamari if you’d like more soy flavor (don’t overdo it or it will drown out the other flavors) or salt, if the dish needs an extra boost of overall flavor.</li><br>
                            <li>Divide into bowls and serve immediately. I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the side. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 to 4 days (if you used purple cabbage, it might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color, but it’s fine to eat).</li><br>
                        </ol>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>olive oil</li>
                            <li>6 medium free-range eggs</li>
                            <li>1 bunch of spring onions</li>
                            <li>55 g mature Cheddar cheese</li>
                            <li>1 large courgette</li>
                            <li>300 g broccoli</li>
                            <li>1 x 250 g pack of ready-rolled filo pastry</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.</li><br>
                            <li>Grease a large 25cm by 35cm roasting tray with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork.</li><br>
                            <li>Layer the filo sheets into the tray, laying one sheet horizontally, and the next vertically, repeating as you layer, brushing a little of the egg between each sheet. (Make sure they cover the base of the tray and go up the sides so it can contain the filling.) Add a final brush to the last layer and scrunch up any excess pastry that hangs over.</li><br>
                            <li>Finely slice the spring onions and add to the bowl. Coarsely grate the Cheddar cheese (reserving a little for the top) and the courgette, then add them to the bowl. Break the broccoli into florets, then thinly slice and add to the bowl. Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then mix together.</li><br>
                            <li>Carefully pour the mixture into the prepared pastry case, spreading it out so it’s in an even layer, then sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.</li><br>
                            <li>Cook for 35 minutes, on the bottom of the oven, until the pastry is golden and the filling is set.</li><br>
                        </ol>
